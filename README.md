# Axelrod-Model
Axelrod's model for social influence, cultural traits dissemination

-There are a basic program for the functions defining the neighbours (it's easy to change the kind of network), the macro step (where all nodes are selected and activated once in average) and the simulations since it converges.
-The other programs are there to extract the tipical main results using the functions defined in axelrod_functions.py and to make some plots. I show some of them.
-The most important result is the distribution of the maximum cluster showing the phase transition from a monoculture state to a multicultural one, as we vary the parameter accounting for the initial cultural variability.
